    <!-- Chosen Palette: Muted Earth Tones & Soft Blues/Greens with a touch of deep purple -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as an interactive dashboard. The top section presents a master "Opportunity Radar" chart, allowing users to immediately compare all business ideas across key metrics (Scalability, Profitability, Low Competition, Low Investment). Below this, users can navigate through clickable cards, one for each business idea. Clicking a card dynamically updates the main content area with a detailed breakdown of that specific idea. This two-layer structure (overview followed by on-demand detail) was chosen to facilitate easy comparison and prevent overwhelming the user with information. It encourages exploration by letting the user guide their own journey, starting with a high-level visual and then drilling into the specifics that interest them most. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: High-level comparison of all ideas across four metrics. -> Goal: Compare. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Radar Chart. -> Interaction: Hover over points to see scores. -> Justification: A radar chart is ideal for comparing multiple subjects (business ideas) across multiple quantitative dimensions simultaneously, providing a quick, holistic "shape" of each opportunity. -> Library/Method: Chart.js/Canvas.
        - Report Info: Switching between different business ideas. -> Goal: Organize/Navigate. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Interactive HTML cards with hover/active states. -> Interaction: Click to load detailed content. -> Justification: This is an intuitive and standard UI pattern for single-page applications, providing clear visual feedback on the user's current selection. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Potential revenue streams for each idea. -> Goal: Inform (Proportions). -> Viz/Presentation Method: Donut Chart. -> Interaction: Hover over segments for details. -> Justification: A donut chart effectively visualizes the composition of a whole, making it easy to understand the potential business model mix at a glance. -> Library/Method: Chart.js/Canvas.
        - Report Info: Detailed analysis (Problem, Solution, Target Audience, etc.). -> Goal: Inform. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Structured text blocks with icons and clear typography. -> Interaction: Content is dynamically loaded on card click. -> Justification: Organizes qualitative information for maximum readability and scannability, using icons to visually anchor key concepts. -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS/JS.
